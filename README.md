_A bot designed for high schools in mind._

## When we're out of some internal testing, we'll document the official functions of the bot :)


I would like to note that because of COVID-19 I graduated my HS early, and henceforth have discontinued my work on this project. I'm not sure if I'll ever pick it up again, if anyone's here to look into the project-- it's *very* close to completion; to my memory, the database work is nearly complete that will allow for the actual commands to be fully implemented. The idea was for the bot to automate the management of a school class database through data provided by students inside of a discord server, and then to use that database to provide students with corresponding roles and channels for all of their classes and subjects. This way, a single official discord for a high school could be created and maintained without a massive effort of the leader/s.
